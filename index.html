						<h3>What is UBI?</h3>
						<p>A basic income is an income unconditionally granted to all on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement. It is a form of minimum income guarantee that differs from those that now exist in various European countries in three important ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>it is being paid to individuals rather than households;</li>
    <li>it is paid irrespective of any income from other sources;</li>
    <li>it is paid without requiring the performance of any work or the willingness to accept a job if offered.</li>
</ul>
						</p>Liberty and equality, efficiency and community, common ownership of the Earth and equal sharing in the benefits of technical progress, the flexibility of the labour market and the dignity of the poor, the fight against inhumane working conditions, against the desertification of the countryside and against interregional inequalities, the viability of cooperatives and the promotion of adult education, autonomy from bosses, husbands and bureaucrats, have all been invoked in its favour.</p>
						<p>But it is the inability to tackle unemployment with conventional means that has led in the last decade or so to the idea being taken seriously throughout Europe by a growing number of scholars and organizations. Social policy and economic policy can no longer be conceived separately, and basic income is increasingly viewed as the only viable way of reconciling two of their respective central objectives: poverty relief and full employment.</p>
						<p>There is a wide variety of proposals around. They differ according to the amounts involved, the source of funding, the nature and size of the reductions in other transfers, and along many other dimensions. As far as short-term proposals are concerned, however, the current discussion is focusing increasingly on so-called partial basic income schemes which would not be full substitutes for present guaranteed income schemes but would provide a low - and slowly increasing - basis to which other incomes, including the remaining social security benefits and means-tested guaranteed income supplements, could be added.</p>
						<p>Many prominent European social scientists have now come out in favour of basic income - among them two Nobel laureates in economics. In a few countries some major politicians, including from parties in government, are also beginning to stick their necks out in support of it. At the same time, the relevant literature - on the economic, ethical, political and legal aspects - is gradually expanding and those promoting the idea, or just interested in it, in various European countries and across the world have started organizing into an active network.

						<h3>What is The Open Fund?</h3>
						<p>This is a fund where one can donate as much as they wish, and participants can withdraw a portion of the available funds.  Each person's dividend is determined by the total available divided by the number of participants. The funds are available to be withdrawn by bank transfer.</p>
						<p>There only requirements are that you need to donate after having withdrawn from the fund for the first time, but this donation can be as much as you would like, and this donation can be less than the amount you wish to withdraw.</p>

						<h3>Why should I participate?</h3>
						<p>So that participants have a "guarantee that no one's income will fall below the level necessary to meet their most basic needs for any reason. As Bertrand Russell put it in 1918, "A certain small income, sufficient for necessities, should be secured for all, whether they work or not, and that a larger income should be given to those who are willing to engage in some work which the community recognizes as useful. On this basis we may build further." (Source: <a href="http://www.usbig.net/whatisbig.php" target="_blank">The U.S. Basic Income Guarantee Network</a>)<p>
